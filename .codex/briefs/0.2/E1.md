# E1 Alignment Brief

## Intent
- Upgrade claims explorer HTML to switch between static data and API sources with sensible defaults.
- Ensure explorer demonstrates counts rendering deterministically from either source.

## Derived Constraints (binding)
- Modify `docs/claims-explorer.html` to support:
  - Static file mode defaulting to `data/claims-ro-mini.json` dated `2025-09-09`.
  - API mode selectable via URL or UI input.
- Rendering logic must canonicalize fetched JSON before computing any hashes or comparisons.
- UI must render counts for whichever source is active; missing data handled gracefully.

## Invariants & Oracles
- Loading the page without params uses static dataset and shows counts.
- Supplying an API URL switches to live data with same rendering path.

## Checklist for Coder
- [ ] Mirrors TS and Rust
- [ ] Uses canonical bytes (no JSON.stringify)
- [ ] Final state ends in r0
- [ ] JSON Pointers start with "/"
- [ ] Effects NF sorted unique
- [ ] Proof tags emitted when DEV_PROOFS=1 (if relevant)

## Lessons referenced
- A1: canonical JSON for comparisons
- D1: API responses and hash usage
