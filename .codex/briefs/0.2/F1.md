# F1 Alignment Brief

## Intent
- Enable GitHub Pages preview artifacts on PRs and automatic deployment on main branch.
- Provide visibility into docs/site changes before merge, supporting observability goals.

## Derived Constraints (binding)
- Pages workflow builds static site and uploads artifact for `pull_request` events.
- On push to main, workflow deploys to GitHub Pages and updates badge in README.
- Build process must be deterministic and rely on canonical assets; no network-only dependencies.

## Invariants & Oracles
- PR workflow attaches downloadable Pages artifact.
- Merging to main updates live Pages site and badge links accordingly.

## Checklist for Coder
- [ ] Mirrors TS and Rust
- [ ] Uses canonical bytes (no JSON.stringify)
- [ ] Final state ends in r0 (N/A)
- [ ] JSON Pointers start with "/" (N/A)
- [ ] Effects NF sorted unique
- [ ] Proof tags emitted when DEV_PROOFS=1 (if relevant)
