# A6 Alignment Brief

## Intent
- Integrate TS and Rust vector runners into CI for every PR and main branch push.
- Guarantee conformance regressions fail CI before merge, preserving cross-runtime determinism.

## Derived Constraints (binding)
- `.github/workflows/conformance.yml` triggers on pull_request and push to main.
- Workflow runs `pnpm -C packages/tf-lang-l0-ts vectors` and `cargo test --manifest-path packages/tf-lang-l0-rs/Cargo.toml`.
- CI must fail if any vector mismatches delta/effect or tests error.
- Artifacts or logs should show vector results for debugging.

## Invariants & Oracles
- Both runners execute in CI and report âœ“ for all vectors on success.
- PRs and main builds show conformance job status.

## Checklist for Coder
- [ ] Mirrors TS and Rust
- [ ] Uses canonical bytes (no JSON.stringify)
- [ ] Final state ends in r0
- [ ] JSON Pointers start with "/"
- [ ] Effects NF sorted unique
- [ ] Proof tags emitted when DEV_PROOFS=1 (if relevant)
