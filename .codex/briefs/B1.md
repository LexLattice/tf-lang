# B1 Alignment Brief

## Intent
- Introduce proof tag interfaces in TS and Rust without altering runtime behavior.
- Prepare for observable proof emissions aligning with v0.2 observability goals.

## Derived Constraints (binding)
- TS: `packages/tf-lang-l0-ts/src/proof/tags.ts` exports enums or type constants for Witness, Refutation, Transport, Normalization, Conservativity.
- Rust: `packages/tf-lang-l0-rs/src/proof.rs` defines equivalent tag structures.
- No functional changes: code compiles and tests remain green.
- Tags are inert until DEV_PROOFS=1 logic is added later.

## Invariants & Oracles
- Build passes with new tag definitions and no behavioral diffs.
- Adding tags does not modify existing public APIs aside from exports.

## Checklist for Coder
- [ ] Mirrors TS and Rust
- [ ] Uses canonical bytes (no JSON.stringify)
- [ ] Final state ends in r0
- [ ] JSON Pointers start with "/"
- [ ] Effects NF sorted unique
- [ ] Proof tags emitted when DEV_PROOFS=1 (if relevant)

## Lessons referenced
- A1: canonicalization baseline
- A2: cross-runtime parity discipline
- A3: vector expectations for tag usage in future
