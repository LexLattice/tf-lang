# F2 Alignment Brief

## Intent
- Publish Docker images for `claims-api-ts` (and `host-lite` if present) to GHCR tagged `0.2` and `latest`.
- Ensure reproducible container builds aligning with v0.2 release process.

## Derived Constraints (binding)
- GitHub workflow builds containers deterministically using pinned dependencies.
- Images pushed to `ghcr.io/<org>/<name>` with tags `0.2` and `latest` on main branch.
- Build uses canonical JSON for any embedded config; avoid runtime-generated timestamps.
- Workflow should fail if push to registry fails.

## Invariants & Oracles
- After workflow, `docker pull ghcr.io/<org>/<name>:0.2` succeeds for targeted services.
- Image digests stable across rebuilds from same commit.

## Checklist for Coder
- [ ] Mirrors TS and Rust
- [ ] Uses canonical bytes (no JSON.stringify)
- [ ] Final state ends in r0
- [ ] JSON Pointers start with "/"
- [ ] Effects NF sorted unique
- [ ] Proof tags emitted when DEV_PROOFS=1 (if relevant)
