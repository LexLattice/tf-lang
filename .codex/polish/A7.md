# Polish Suggestions for A7

- Remove unused `json` import in `packages/tf-lang-l0-rs/src/ops/bounds.rs` to silence warnings.
- Validate the bound argument in `delta_bounded` (TS/Rust) is non-negative to avoid accepting negative limits.
- `correct/saturate@0.1` currently only returns the clamped value; consider emitting the required journal entry `{field, before, after, reason}`.
