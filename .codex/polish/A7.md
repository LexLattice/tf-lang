# Polish Review for A7

- Validate that `bounds` ops treat `min`/`max` only as integers; reject non-integer values in both TS and Rust.
- `correct/saturate` currently only clamps the value; add a journal note `{field, before, after, reason}` when a correction occurs.
- `probe/delta_bounded` returns only a boolean; consider returning failure evidence `{index, delta}` to match brief.
