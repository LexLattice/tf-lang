# REPORT — C1 — Run 1

## End Goal fulfillment
- EG-1: In-memory Fastify host exposes only `/plan` and `/apply` endpoints【F:services/host-lite/src/server.ts†L17-L78】
- EG-2: Identical `POST /plan` and `POST /apply` calls return byte-identical responses【F:services/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts†L10-L18】
- EG-3: Journal entries are canonical with proofs gated by `DEV_PROOFS`【F:services/host-lite/src/server.ts†L31-L36】【F:services/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts†L22-L42】
- EG-4: World state resets on restart, ensuring ephemerality【F:services/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts†L47-L58】

## Blockers honored
- B-1: ✅ Only `/plan` and `/apply` endpoints, in-memory state, and idempotent caching【F:services/host-lite/src/server.ts†L17-L78】
- B-2: ✅ Proof artifacts behind `DEV_PROOFS` and deterministic canonical outputs【F:services/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts†L22-L42】

## Lessons / tradeoffs (≤5 bullets)
- Canonical response caching ensures byte-level idempotency.
- Relative workspace imports required for unexported modules.
- Double JSON parsing trades speed for determinism.
- Fastify.inject enables isolation without network sockets.
- Environment flag toggles proof emission for development only.

### OBS_LOG.md

# Observation Log — C1 — Run 1

- Strategy chosen: Fastify server with canonical JSON caching and in-memory worlds.
- Key changes (files): services/host-lite/src/server.ts; services/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts; pnpm-lock.yaml
- Determinism stress (runs × passes): 2×; stable outputs.
- Near-misses vs blockers: initial response order broke idempotency; fixed by returning canonical JSON.
- Notes: DEV_PROOFS toggled in tests to verify gating.
```

### CHANGES.md
```md
# C1 — Changes (Run 1)

## Summary
Implemented an in-memory Fastify host exposing only `POST /plan` and `POST /apply`,
ensuring idempotent requests and canonical journals with optional proofs.

## Why
- Satisfies END_GOAL: minimal HTTP host with ephemeral state and proof gating.

## Tests
- Added: `services/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts`
- Updated: none
- Determinism/parity: repeated runs yield identical responses and reset state.

## Notes
- No schema changes unless explicitly allowed.
- Diffs kept minimal.

- EG-2: Canonical journal entries with proofs gated by `DEV_PROOFS` — services/host-lite-ts/tests/host-lite.test.ts

## Blockers honored

- B-2: ✅ Deterministic canonical outputs; proofs behind env flag — services/host-lite-ts/tests/host-lite.test.ts

## Lessons / tradeoffs (≤5 bullets)
- Runtime environment checks enable flexible proof gating.
- Stateless design simplifies idempotency.
- Canonical JSON helpers avoid ordering drift.
- Using built-in `http` keeps dependencies minimal.

## Tests
- Added: services/host-lite-ts/tests/host-lite.test.ts
- Updated: none

## End Goal fulfillment
- EG-1: Minimal HTTP host serving only `/plan` and `/apply` with idempotent, canonical replies — see `http-lite.ts`.

- B-2: ✅ Deterministic outputs and proof gating respected — `host-lite.test.ts`.

## Lessons / tradeoffs (≤5 bullets)

- [x] No changes to existing kernel semantics or tag schemas from A/B — code only adds an HTTP host.

- [x] ESM internal imports must include `.js` — see imports in `http-lite.ts`.
- [x] Tests run in parallel without cross-test state bleed — each test spins up its own server.
- [x] Outputs must be deterministic (canonical JSON bytes & hashes where relevant) — responses built via `canonicalJsonBytes`.
- [x] Host must not use files or external DBs; in-memory only — worlds stored in `Map`.
- [x] Only `/plan` and `/apply` endpoints are allowed — other paths return `404`.
- [x] `/plan` and `/apply` must be idempotent — responses cached by request hash.
- [x] Proof artifacts must be gated behind `DEV_PROOFS=1` — proofs included only when flag enabled.

## Acceptance (oracle)

# C1 — Changes (Run 1)

## Summary
Implemented a minimal in-memory HTTP host exposing only `POST /plan` and `POST /apply`. Responses are canonical and idempotent, with optional proof tags when `DEV_PROOFS=1`. World state remains ephemeral.

## Why
- Minimal host with idempotent endpoints and canonical journals fulfils the C1 end goal.

## Tests
- Added: `packages/tf-lang-l0-ts/tests/host-lite.test.ts`
- Updated: none
- Determinism/parity: repeated HTTP calls return byte-identical responses; tests run in isolated servers.

## Notes
- No schema changes unless explicitly allowed.
- Diffs kept minimal.

## Tests
- Added: `packages/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts`
