# COMPLIANCE — C1 — Run 4

## Blockers (must all be ✅)
- [x] No kernel/schema changes — code link: packages/host-lite/src/server.ts
- [x] No per-call locks or `as any` — code link: packages/host-lite/src/server.ts
- [x] ESM internal imports include `.js` — test link: packages/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts
- [x] Tests parallel-safe, no global bleed — test link: packages/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts
- [x] Deterministic canonical outputs — code/test link: packages/host-lite/src/server.ts
- [x] In-memory host only `/plan` & `/apply` — code link: packages/host-lite/src/server.ts
- [x] `/plan` and `/apply` idempotent — test link: packages/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts
- [x] Proofs gated behind `DEV_PROOFS=1` — test link: packages/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts
- [x] Per-world LRU cache cap 32 — code/test link: packages/host-lite/src/server.ts
- [x] No new runtime dependencies — code link: packages/host-lite/package.json
- [x] Tests hermetic (no sockets/network) — test link: packages/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts

## EXTRA BLOCKERS
- [x] Do not edit `.codex/tasks/**` — n/a
- [x] Deep import sweep clean — test link: packages/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts
- [x] Package exports remain `src/server.ts` — code/test link: packages/host-lite/package.json

## Acceptance (oracle)
- [x] Enable/disable behavior
- [x] Cache cold→warm; reset forces re-read
- [x] Parallel determinism (repeat runs stable)
- [ ] Cross-runtime parity (if applicable)
- [x] Build/packaging correctness (ESM)
- [x] Code quality (minimal diff)
- [x] 404/400 canonical errors — test link: packages/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts
- [x] Multi-world cache bound proof — test link: packages/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts

## Evidence
- Code: packages/host-lite/src/server.ts; packages/host-lite/package.json
- Tests: packages/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts
- CI runs: pnpm -F host-lite-ts test
- Bench (off-mode, if applicable): n/a
