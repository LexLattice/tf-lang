## Blockers honored
- B-1: ✅ Deterministic in-memory host with per-world LRU cap 32【F:packages/host-lite/src/server.ts†L13-L36】【F:packages/host-lite/tests/host-lite.test.ts†L82-L105】

## Lessons / tradeoffs (≤5 bullets)
- Centralized JSON parsing simplified tests and server wiring.
- Deep import sweep restricted to package to avoid cross-repo noise.
- Cache map size check confirmed multi-world isolation.
- Using package name in tests avoided deep import violations.
- Canonical bytes derived once per exec for determinism.

### CHANGES.md
```md
# C1 — Changes (Run 4)

## Summary
Finalized `host-lite` with a raw JSON handler to unify `/plan` and `/apply`, enforcing canonical bytes and stricter error paths.

## Why
- Delivers deterministic, idempotent planning/apply with per-world LRU and proof gating.

## Tests
- Added: byte determinism, DEV_PROOFS gating, deep import sweep, package export guard.
- Updated: cache bounds to track world count, consolidated error checks.
- Determinism/parity: repeated `pnpm -F host-lite-ts test` runs stable; no sockets/network.

## Notes
- In-memory only; no new runtime deps.

### CHANGES.md

# C1 — Changes (Run 4)

## Summary
Added `makeRawHandler` to parse raw JSON and share exec path, wired `createServer` through it for canonical byte responses, and expanded tests for determinism, cache sizing, import hygiene, and package exports.

## Why
- Finalizes host-lite endpoint behavior with explicit JSON parsing, idempotent plan/apply outputs, and per-world LRU.

## Tests
- Added: raw handler 400s, byte-identical plan/apply, cache map size, import sweep, package export check.
- Updated: proof gating, multi-world cache bounds.
- Determinism/parity: repeated `pnpm -F host-lite-ts test` runs stable; no sockets/files/network.

## Notes
- No schema changes.
- Diffs kept minimal.

## Summary
Finalized `host-lite` with a raw JSON handler and canonical Node server wiring. Responses are byte-stable, proofs remain gated, and per-world caches stay bounded.

## Why
- Consolidates plan/apply exec path and centralizes JSON parsing for deterministic error and data handling.

## Tests
- Added: raw handler determinism, proof gating counts, route/method 404s, malformed JSON 400, multi-world LRU map-size check, import sweep.
- Determinism/parity: repeated `pnpm -F host-lite-ts test` runs stable; no sockets/network.

## Notes
- No schema changes; no new runtime deps.

## Summary
Finalized `host-lite` with a raw JSON handler shared across `/plan` and `/apply`, ensuring canonical bytes and a unified exec path.

## Why
- Completes END_GOAL by delivering deterministic, idempotent endpoints with LRU caching and proof gating.

## Tests
- Added: byte determinism, raw handler 400s, import hygiene, package export guard.
- Updated: multi-world cache bounds now assert map size.
- Determinism/parity: repeated `pnpm test` runs stable; no sockets/files/network.

## Notes
- No schema changes unless explicitly allowed.
- Diffs kept minimal.
