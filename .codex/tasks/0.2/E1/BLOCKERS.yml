- No changes to kernel semantics/tag schemas from A/B.
- No per-call locks; no `static mut`/`unsafe`; no TS `as any`.
- ESM internal imports must include `.js`.
- Tests run in parallel without state bleed; outputs deterministic (canonical where relevant).
- Static file mode must not issue network requests.
- Source switching must be runtime-selectable (no rebuild/restart).
- A default dataset and default date must be present on first load.
- Tags panel must remain hidden when no tags exist.
