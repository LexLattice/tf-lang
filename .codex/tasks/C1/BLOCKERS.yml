- No changes to existing kernel semantics or tag schemas from A/B.
- No per-call locks on hot paths; no `static mut`/`unsafe`; no TS `as any`.
- ESM internal imports must include `.js`.
- Tests run in parallel without cross-test state bleed.
- Outputs must be deterministic (canonical JSON bytes & hashes where relevant).
- Host must not use files or external DBs; in-memory only.
- Only `/plan` and `/apply` endpoints are allowed.
- `/plan` and `/apply` must be idempotent.
- Proof artifacts must be gated behind `DEV_PROOFS=1`.
