- No changes to kernel semantics/tag schemas from A/B.
- No per-call locks; no `static mut`/`unsafe`; no TS `as any`.
- ESM internal imports must include `.js`.
- Tests run in parallel without state bleed; outputs deterministic (canonical bytes + BLAKE3).
- Storage is strictly **SQLite** (no other DBs/networked storage).
- Responses must include both `dataset_version` and canonical BLAKE3 `query_hash`.
- Identical queries must not vary in counts/clauses; â‰¥ 10 evidence samples required.
