- Source switch: toggling between API and static sources preserves state and does not reload the page.
- Offline: with network disabled, static mode still loads and renders.
- Defaults: default dataset/date appear on first load when none are provided.
- Tags panel: absent in DOM when dataset has no tags; present otherwise.
- Determinism: repeated renders (both sources) produce identical output structure.
