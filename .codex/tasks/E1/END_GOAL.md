Perspective: Synthesized (Reliability + DX)

- Explorer can switch at runtime between **static file** mode (offline) and **API** mode.
- First load has a sensible **default dataset and date** preselected.
- When a dataset has no tags, the **tags panel is hidden**.
- Rendering remains **deterministic** irrespective of source.
