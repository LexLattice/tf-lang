- No changes to kernel semantics/tag schemas from A/B.
- No per-call locks; no `static mut`/`unsafe`; no TS `as any`.
- ESM internal imports must include `.js`.
- Tests run in parallel without state bleed; outputs deterministic.
- Images must be tagged `0.2` and `latest` in GHCR.
- PR builds must skip publishing; pushes allowed only on `main`.
