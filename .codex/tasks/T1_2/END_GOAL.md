# T1_2 â€” Oracle Standard Library

1)  Create an `oracles/core` package to house the standard library of oracles.
    - *Why*: A centralized package provides a clear entry point for using and extending the oracle library.

2)  Define the core oracle interfaces and a common result type with explainable failures.
    - *Why*: A shared interface and result type ensure a consistent and predictable experience for developers.

3)  Implement stubs for the core oracles with unit tests.
    - *Why*: Stubs provide a starting point for implementation and allow for early integration and testing.
