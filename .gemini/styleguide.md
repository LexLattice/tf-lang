# Repository Style & Safety Guide (Project-Agnostic)

- Keep suggestions **atomic**: one behavior or one style concern per comment.
- Prefer safe defaults; avoid changes to public APIs unless requested.
- Mirror invariants from `policy/invariants.md` when present.
- Require tests for behavior changes; suggest test diffs when missing.
- Respect ignore patterns and generated code directories.
