# AGENTS

Agents should self-identify (family/role), load the referenced files, and apply rules by precedence:
**role &gt; family &gt; global**. When rules conflict, the more specific wins.

```yaml agent_routing
version: 1
layers:
  - id: "*"
    name: "Global"
    includes:
      - policy/invariants.md           # optional: domain rules live elsewhere
      - plans/current.md               # optional: points at the active brief
    rules:
      - "Prefer determinism, reproducibility, and auditability."
      - "Minimize diff surface; keep changes explainable."
      - "Every behavior change must include tests and docs."
      - "Cite the rationale for non-trivial changes in the PR."
  - id: "codex/*"
    name: "Codex family"
    includes:
      - agents/codex/master_prompt.md  # project-independent scaffolding
    rules:
      - "Propose coherent, multi-file edits when intent/effect diverge."
      - "Bundle suggested commits logically; keep patch atomic when possible."
      - "Summarize impact across code, tests, and tooling."
  - id: "gemini/*"
    name: "Gemini family"
    includes:
      - .gemini/styleguide.md          # mirrors policy/invariants in Gemini form
      - .gemini/config.yaml
    rules:
      - "Prefer inline suggestions; keep each suggestion single-purpose."
      - "Respect repository ignore patterns and code owners."
  - id: "codex/coder"
    name: "Codex role: coder"
    includes:
      - agents/codex/roles/coder.md
      - plans/current.md               # binds to the active task/brief if present
    rules:
      - "Implement per brief; if ambiguous, propose a minimal RFC comment first."
      - "Update/extend tests alongside code; keep CI green."
  - id: "codex/reviewer"
    name: "Codex role: reviewer"
    includes:
      - agents/codex/roles/reviewer.md
    rules:
      - "Review intent vs. effect; suggest fixes with clear acceptance criteria."
  - id: "codex/ontology-reviewer"
    name: "Codex role: ontology-reviewer"
    includes:
      - agents/codex/roles/ontology_reviewer.md
    rules:
      - "Check concept consistency, naming, and invariants across specs and code."
  - id: "gemini/reviewer"
    name: "Gemini role: reviewer"
    includes:
      - .gemini/styleguide.md
    rules:
      - "Surface scoped, actionable comments (style → safety → logic)."
```

## How agents should use this file

1. Identify your **family/role** (e.g., `codex/coder`).
2. Load `includes` for `*`, then your **family**, then your **role**.
3. Apply **rules** with the precedence above.
4. If an `includes` file is missing, proceed with remaining layers and note the omission.

### Minimal invocation hints (so you don’t repeat task context)

* **Codex / coder**:
  `@codex you are codex/coder. Load AGENTS.md and follow your includes. Implement per the active brief.`
* **Codex / reviewer**:
  `@codex you are codex/reviewer. Load AGENTS.md; run an intent-vs-effect review and propose fixes.`
* **Gemini / reviewer**:
  Add the bot as reviewer; it reads `.gemini/*`. No extra prompt needed.
