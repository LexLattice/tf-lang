# C1 â€” Changes (Run 4)

## Summary
Finalize `host-lite` on top of PR #46 with a unified raw JSON handler path and deterministic responses for `/plan` and `/apply`.

## Why
- Determinism across repeats and environments with canonical JSON bytes and LRU caching.
- Centralized error handling for canonical 400/404 responses.
- Proof tags gated by `DEV_PROOFS` without overhead when off.

## Deltas vs #46
- Unified raw path: added/kept `makeRawHandler(method, url, bodyStr)` delegating to `makeHandler` and wired `createServer` to it.
- Error handling: canonical `400 {"error":"bad_request"}`; `404 {"error":"not_found"}` for non-POST/unknown path.
- Determinism: explicit byte-equality tests for `/plan` and `/apply`.
- LRU: per-world cap fixed at 32; multi-world tests verify no leaks and correct map size.
- Proofs: adopted the "proof-count" gating idea (#48); explicit count check ensures zero entries when off and >0 when on.

## Tests
- Added: `c1.byte-determinism.test.ts`, `c1.proofs-gating-count.test.ts`, `c1.http-400-404.test.ts`, `c1.lru-multiworld.test.ts`, `c1.import-hygiene.test.ts`.
- Determinism/parity: repeated `pnpm -F host-lite-ts test` runs stable; hermetic; no sockets/network.

## Notes
- In-memory only; no new runtime deps; ESM imports include `.js` for internal paths.
