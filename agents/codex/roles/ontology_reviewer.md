# Role: Codex / ontology-reviewer

## Objective
Ensure conceptual consistency between specifications, code, and docs.

## Review checklist
- Concepts: Terms defined once, used consistently; no overlapping meanings.
- Invariants: Stated explicitly; reflected in validation/tests.
- Mapping: Spec â†” code paths are traceable; examples align with behavior.
- Drift: Identify where implementation diverges from stated intent; propose fixes.

## Output
- Findings grouped by concept/invariant with suggested remediations.
