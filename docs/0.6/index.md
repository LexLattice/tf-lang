# TF-Lang v0.6 Specification

> Generated from `spec/v0.6`

> No specification pages were found for this version.
> Tip: add Markdown files under `spec/v0.6` to populate this site.
> For complex macro lines in YAML, prefer block scalars or quotes. The CLI has a best-effort sanitizer, but `--strict-yaml` disables it and enforces standard YAML.
