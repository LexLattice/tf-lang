## Summary of Changes

Hello @andreidita22, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request establishes foundational data structures for a proof system by defining a comprehensive set of proof tag interfaces and their union type in TypeScript, alongside their corresponding enum and struct equivalents in Rust. The primary goal is to ensure consistent representation and functionality across both language runtimes, supported by dedicated unit tests to verify proper tag construction.

### Highlights

* **Proof Tag Definitions**: Introduced new data structures for "proof tags" in both TypeScript and Rust, including Witness, Normalization, Transport, Refutation, and Conservativity types.
* **Cross-Runtime Parity**: Ensured equivalent definitions and functionality for proof tags across the TypeScript and Rust runtimes.
* **Test Coverage**: Added unit tests in both TypeScript and Rust to validate the correct construction and behavior of the newly defined proof tag variants.

## Code Review

This pull request introduces proof tag interfaces in both TypeScript and Rust, along with corresponding tests. The changes are well-structured. My review focuses primarily on ensuring the Rust data structures will serialize to a format that is compatible with the TypeScript interfaces, which is crucial for the stated goal of cross-runtime parity. I've identified several critical mismatches in the `serde` serialization behavior and have provided suggestions to align the Rust and TypeScript representations. I've also included a suggestion to improve the Rust test structure.

## Summary of Changes

Hello @andreidita22, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request establishes foundational type definitions for various "proof tags" in both TypeScript and Rust. The primary purpose is to standardize how different types of proofs are represented across the system's different language environments. This ensures consistent data structures and facilitates future development where these tags will be utilized for runtime proof emission.

### Highlights

* **Proof Tag Definitions**: Introduced comprehensive proof tag definitions in both TypeScript and Rust, ensuring type parity across runtimes for various proof types like Witness, Normalization, Transport, Refutation, and Conservativity.
* **Module Exposure**: Implemented and exported new modules for these proof tags in both the `tf-lang-l0-ts` and `tf-lang-l0-rs` packages, making them accessible for future use.
* **Unit Testing**: Added dedicated unit tests in both TypeScript and Rust to validate the structural integrity and compilation of the new proof tag types, ensuring their correctness.
* **Documentation**: Documented a new rule specifying that proof tags are inert and do not affect hash calculations, clarifying their role in the system.

## Code Review

This pull request introduces proof tag interfaces in both TypeScript and Rust, ensuring type consistency across the two runtimes. The new types are exported from their respective packages. The changes are well-structured and the type definitions in both languages are consistent. My review focuses on improving the accompanying tests, which currently only serve as compile-time checks. I've suggested adding serialization/deserialization tests in Rust and more specific property assertions in TypeScript to make the tests more robust and meaningful.

+# Plan for Task B1
+
+## Steps
+1. Create `packages/tf-lang-l0-ts/src/proof/tags.ts` defining tag interfaces `Witness`, `Normalization`, `Transport`, `Refutation`, and `Conservativity`.
+2. Re-export the tags through `packages/tf-lang-l0-ts/src/index.ts`.
+3. Define equivalent structures in Rust at `packages/tf-lang-l0-rs/src/proof.rs` with a `Tag` enum and supporting enums.
+4. Expose the Rust proof module by editing `packages/tf-lang-l0-rs/src/lib.rs`.
+5. Add unit tests in TS and Rust that instantiate each tag type to ensure shapes compile.
+6. Run `pnpm -C packages/tf-lang-l0-ts test`, `pnpm -C packages/tf-lang-l0-ts vectors`, and `cargo test --manifest-path packages/tf-lang-l0-rs/Cargo.toml`.
+7. Append a journal entry and add a lesson if a new general rule emerges.
+
+## Test Changes
+- `pnpm -C packages/tf-lang-l0-ts test`
+- `pnpm -C packages/tf-lang-l0-ts vectors`
+- `cargo test --manifest-path packages/tf-lang-l0-rs/Cargo.toml`
+
+## Risks & Rollback
+- Tag shapes may drift between TS and Rust; verify symmetry.
+- Tests may fail if tags accidentally alter runtime behavior; ensure definitions are type-only.
+- Rollback by removing new files and reverting modified exports.
+
+## Definition of Done
+- Tag interfaces/enums defined and exported in both runtimes.
+- Tests and vectors pass.
+- Journal updated; lesson added if applicable.

I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\n\nThis pull request establishes foundational type definitions for various \"proof tags\" in both TypeScript and Rust. The primary purpose is to standardize how different types of proofs are represented across the system's different language environments. This ensures consistent data structures and facilitates future development where these tags will be utilized for runtime proof emission.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* **Proof Tag Definitions**: Introduced comprehensive proof tag definitions in both TypeScript and Rust, ensuring type parity across runtimes for various proof types like Witness, Normalization, Transport, Refutation, and Conservativity.\n* **Module Exposure**: Implemented and exported new modules for these proof tags in both the `tf-lang-l0-ts` and `tf-lang-l0-rs` packages, making them accessible for future use.\n* **Unit Testing**: Added dedicated unit tests in both TypeScript and Rust to validate the structural integrity and compilation of the new proof tag types, ensuring their correctness.\n* **Documentation**: Documented a new rule specifying that proof tags are inert and do not affect hash calculations, clarifying their role in the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\n<br>\n\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\n\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\n\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point in your pull request via creating an issue comment (i.e. comment on the pull request page) using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.

## Summary of Changes

Hello @andreidita22, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request introduces a foundational mechanism for "proof tags" across both TypeScript and Rust runtimes. These tags are designed to provide structured metadata for various operations, such as witnessing state changes, normalization, transport, refutation, and conservativity checks. By defining these tags consistently in both languages and including initial unit tests, the PR establishes a common framework for future debugging, tracing, and formal verification efforts within the system.

### Highlights

* **TypeScript Proof Tag Definitions**: New TypeScript interfaces for various proof tag types (Witness, Normalization, Transport, Refutation, Conservativity) have been defined and exported, establishing the payload shapes.
* **Rust Proof Tag Implementation**: Corresponding Rust enums and structs for proof tags have been implemented, mirroring the TypeScript definitions, and exposed as a new module within the Rust package.
* **Cross-Runtime Unit Tests**: Unit tests have been added in both TypeScript and Rust to verify the correct construction and behavior of these new proof tag structures, ensuring consistency across runtimes.

+# Plan for B1
+
+## Steps
+- Define proof tag interfaces in TS under `src/proof/tags.ts`.
+- Re-export tags via `src/proof/index.ts` and package root.
+- Mirror structures in Rust at `src/proof.rs` and expose module.
+- Add lightweight tests in TS and Rust that instantiate a sample tag.
+- Update journal and lessons if a general rule emerges.
+
+## Tests
+- `pnpm -C packages/tf-lang-l0-ts build`
+- `pnpm -C packages/tf-lang-l0-ts test`
+- `cargo test --manifest-path packages/tf-lang-l0-rs/Cargo.toml --tests`
+
+## Risks
+- Type mismatches between TS and Rust structures.
+- Unused code or exports causing lints to fail.
+
+## Definition of Done
+- New tag interfaces compile in both runtimes.
+- Existing tests stay green and new tests pass.
+- Journal updated; lessons appended if needed.

## Summary of Changes

Hello @andreidita22, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request introduces foundational data structures for "proof tags" in both TypeScript and Rust. The primary goal is to establish a consistent, type-safe representation of these tags across the two language runtimes, facilitating future interoperability and data exchange, particularly for JSON serialization.

### Highlights

* **TypeScript Proof Tag Definitions**: Defined and exported TypeScript interfaces for various "proof tags" (Witness, Normalization, Transport, Refutation, Conservativity) from the kernel, establishing their shapes and types.
* **Rust Proof Tag Mirroring**: Mirrored these proof tag structures as enums in Rust, ensuring cross-language compatibility and consistency in data representation.
* **Compilation Tests**: Implemented compilation tests in both TypeScript and Rust to verify the correct construction and usage of these new tag types, ensuring type safety and functional correctness.
* **JSON Serialization Support**: Derived `serde` traits (`Serialize` and `Deserialize`) for the Rust proof tag enums to enable future JSON serialization and deserialization, ensuring data encoding parity with TypeScript shapes.

## Code Review

This pull request introduces proof tag interfaces for both TypeScript and Rust, which is a great step towards unifying the type systems. The implementation is clean and follows the planned structure. My review focuses on ensuring the Rust and TypeScript representations are compatible when serialized to JSON. I've found a few critical discrepancies in the `serde` configuration for the Rust enums that would lead to serialization mismatches. The suggested changes use `serde` attributes to correctly configure the enum tagging and variant naming to align with the TypeScript definitions. Additionally, I've recommended enhancing the Rust tests to include serialization checks, which will help prevent similar issues in the future.

+# Plan for Task B1
+
+## Steps
+1. **Define TypeScript proof tags**
+   - Create `packages/tf-lang-l0-ts/src/proof/tags.ts` exporting tag payload shapes: `Witness`, `Normalization`, `Transport`, `Refutation`, `Conservativity`.
+   - Export a `ProofTag` union and re-export tags from the package root.
+2. **Define Rust proof tags**
+   - Add `packages/tf-lang-l0-rs/src/proof.rs` with equivalent enum variants and supporting enums for normalization targets and transport ops.
+   - Expose the module via `packages/tf-lang-l0-rs/src/lib.rs`.
+3. **Add compilation tests**
+   - TS: write `packages/tf-lang-l0-ts/tests/proof.tags.test.ts` instantiating each tag shape.
+   - Rust: add `packages/tf-lang-l0-rs/tests/proof.rs` constructing each enum variant.
+4. **Documentation**
+   - Append brief `[B1]` entry to `.codex/JOURNAL.md` summarizing the addition.
+
+## Test Changes
+- `pnpm -C packages/tf-lang-l0-ts build`
+- `pnpm -C packages/tf-lang-l0-ts test`
+- `cargo test --manifest-path packages/tf-lang-l0-rs/Cargo.toml`
+
+## Risks & Rollback
+- **Type mismatches:** TS and Rust tag structures may diverge; ensure field names and discriminants match.
+- **Unused exports:** Adding new exports could affect build; confirm tree-shaking keeps runtime unaffected.
+- Rollback by removing newly added files and exports if compilation fails.
+
+## Definition of Done
+- Tag structures exist in both runtimes and are exported.
+- Tests compile and pass in TS and Rust.
+- Journal updated.

I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\n\nThis pull request introduces foundational data structures for \"proof tags\" in both TypeScript and Rust. The primary goal is to establish a consistent, type-safe representation of these tags across the two language runtimes, facilitating future interoperability and data exchange, particularly for JSON serialization.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* **TypeScript Proof Tag Definitions**: Defined and exported TypeScript interfaces for various \"proof tags\" (Witness, Normalization, Transport, Refutation, Conservativity) from the kernel, establishing their shapes and types.\n* **Rust Proof Tag Mirroring**: Mirrored these proof tag structures as enums in Rust, ensuring cross-language compatibility and consistency in data representation.\n* **Compilation Tests**: Implemented compilation tests in both TypeScript and Rust to verify the correct construction and usage of these new tag types, ensuring type safety and functional correctness.\n* **JSON Serialization Support**: Derived `serde` traits (`Serialize` and `Deserialize`) for the Rust proof tag enums to enable future JSON serialization and deserialization, ensuring data encoding parity with TypeScript shapes.\n\n\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\n<br>\n\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\n\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\n\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point in your pull request via creating an issue comment (i.e. comment on the pull request page) using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.

The implementation is clean and follows the planned structure. My review focuses on ensuring the Rust and TypeScript representations are compatible when serialized to JSON. I've found a few critical discrepancies in the `serde` configuration for the Rust enums that would lead to serialization mismatches. The suggested changes use `serde` attributes to correctly configure the enum tagging and variant naming to align with the TypeScript definitions. Additionally, I've recommended enhancing the Rust tests to include serialization checks, which will help prevent similar issues in the future.","submittedAt":"2025-09-11T23:02:17Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"8f9c38f821471a40947d79c953a4f3df54255fee"}}],"statusCheckRollup":[{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-09-11T22:57:26Z","conclusion":"SUCCESS","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/LexLattice/tf-lang/actions/runs/17659365459/job/50189556432","name":"conformance","startedAt":"2025-09-11T22:56:53Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"Conformance (TS ‚Üî Rust)"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-09-11T22:57:03Z","conclusion":"SUCCESS","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/LexLattice/tf-lang/actions/runs/17659365439/job/50189556471","name":"TypeScript build & test","startedAt":"2025-09-11T22:56:54Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"ci"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-09-11T22:56:58Z","conclusion":"SUCCESS","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/LexLattice/tf-lang/actions/runs/17659365457/job/50189556452","name":"changed","startedAt":"2025-09-11T22:56:54Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"ci-fast"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-09-11T22:57:23Z","conclusion":"SUCCESS","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/LexLattice/tf-lang/actions/runs/17659365439/job/50189556461","name":"Rust build & test","startedAt":"2025-09-11T22:56:54Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"ci"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-09-11T22:57:14Z","conclusion":"SUCCESS","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/LexLattice/tf-lang/actions/runs/17659365457/job/50189561314","name":"ts","startedAt":"2025-09-11T22:57:01Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"ci-fast"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-09-11T22:57:41Z","conclusion":"SUCCESS","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/LexLattice/tf-lang/actions/runs/17659365457/job/50189561318","name":"rust","startedAt":"2025-09-11T22:57:01Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"ci-fast"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-09-11T22:56:59Z","conclusion":"SKIPPED","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/LexLattice/tf-lang/actions/runs/17659365457/job/50189561504","name":"golden","startedAt":"2025-09-11T22:56:59Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"ci-fast"}],"title":"feat: add proof tag interfaces (B1)","updatedAt":"2025-09-11T23:02:17Z","url":"https://github.com/LexLattice/tf-lang/pull/22"}
