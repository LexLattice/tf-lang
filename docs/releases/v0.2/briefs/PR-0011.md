# PR #11 — test: add conformance vector runners in TS and Rust (A4/A5)

- PR: [#11](https://github.com/LexLattice/tf-lang/pull/11)

## Brief (verbatim)
```
## Summary
- add TypeScript vector runner that lints fixtures, normalizes effects, and writes hashed `ts-report.json`
- add Rust conformance tests that execute shared vectors with effect-tracking host and emit `rs-report.json`

## Testing
- `pnpm -C packages/tf-lang-l0-ts build`
- `pnpm -C packages/tf-lang-l0-ts vectors`
- `cargo test --manifest-path packages/tf-lang-l0-rs/Cargo.toml --tests -- --nocapture`
```

## Summary (5 bullets)
- TS runner lints fixtures, normalizes effects, and writes `ts-report.json`.
- Rust tests execute shared vectors and emit `rs-report.json`.
- Adds `.github/workflows/conformance.yml` to run parity checks.
- Establishes repeatable reporting for cross‑runtime comparisons.
- No API changes; tooling and tests only.
