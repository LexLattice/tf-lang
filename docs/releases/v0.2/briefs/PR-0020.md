# PR #20 — feat: add proof tag interfaces (B1)

- PR: [#20](https://github.com/LexLattice/tf-lang/pull/20)

## Brief (verbatim)
```
## Summary
- define proof tag types in TypeScript and export them from the package
- add matching tag enums and structs in Rust and expose the module
- cover new tags with compilation tests and document inert-tag rule

## Testing
- `pnpm -C packages/tf-lang-l0-ts test`
- `pnpm -C packages/tf-lang-l0-ts vectors`
- `cargo test --manifest-path packages/tf-lang-l0-rs/Cargo.toml`
```

## Summary (5 bullets)
- Introduces proof tag types and exports in TS.
- Adds Rust enums/structs and exposes module.
- Compilation tests and inert‑tag rule documented.
- Sets foundation for later proof gating and UI.
- No runtime effect unless proofs are enabled.
