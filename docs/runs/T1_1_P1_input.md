- **gemini-code-assist** (COMMENTED): ## Summary of Changes

Hello @andreidita22, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request establishes the foundational tf-spec system, providing a standardized JSON schema for defining operational intents within the project. It includes the schema definition, clear documentation, and practical examples. Crucially, it introduces cross-language adapters in TypeScript and Rust to facilitate seamless integration and manipulation of these specifications across different parts of the codebase, ensuring consistency and ease of use.

### Highlights

* **Introduced tf-spec Schema**: A new JSON schema (tf-spec.schema.json) has been added to define a minimal intent format for goals, invariants, gates, lenses, and effects.
* **Comprehensive Documentation & Examples**: The tf-spec is documented in docs/specs/tf-spec.md and includes validating examples (examples/specs/*.json) to illustrate its usage.
* **Cross-Language Adapters**: Adapters for parsing, canonicalizing, and serializing tf-spec objects have been implemented in both TypeScript (packages/tf-lang-l0-ts/src/spec/adapter.ts) and Rust (packages/tf-lang-l0-rs/src/spec/adapter.rs).
* **Robust Testing**: Dedicated test files (packages/tf-lang-l0-ts/tests/spec.adapter.test.ts and packages/tf-lang-l0-rs/tests/spec_adapter.rs) ensure the round-trip parity and correctness of the tf-spec adapters.
* **Schema Validation Script**: A new script (scripts/validate-tf-spec.mjs) has been added to validate the tf-spec examples against the schema using ajv, which was added as a dev dependency.

- **gemini-code-assist** (COMMENTED): ## Code Review

This pull request introduces a new `tf-spec` JSON schema, along with documentation, examples, and corresponding adapters in both TypeScript and Rust. The changes are well-structured and include tests for round-trip serialization, which is great.

My review focuses on improving the robustness of the TypeScript adapter and increasing the clarity and strictness of the schema and its documentation. I've identified a high-severity issue in the TypeScript `parseSpec` function where the lack of proper type validation could lead to runtime errors or incorrect behavior. I've also included medium-severity suggestions to tighten the definition of the `effect` field in the JSON schema and its documentation to better align with the provided examples.

Hello @andreidita22, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request lays the groundwork for a robust intent definition system by introducing a formal TF specification schema. It provides the necessary tools and documentation to define, validate, and process these intents consistently across TypeScript and Rust environments, ensuring that all operations adhere to a clear and predictable structure. The changes are focused on establishing this core capability without altering existing virtual machine or operation logic.

### Highlights

* **Core TF Spec Schema**: Introduced a core TF specification schema (`tf-spec.schema.json`) to standardize the format for defining operational intents, ensuring consistency and enabling validation.
* **Cross-Language Adapters**: Developed cross-language adapters in both TypeScript and Rust for parsing, canonicalizing, and serializing TF specifications, facilitating seamless integration across different parts of the system.
* **Validation Pipeline**: Established a validation pipeline, including documentation (`tf-spec.md`), example specifications, and a new script (`validate-tf-spec.mjs`) to automatically verify compliance against the defined schema.

- **gemini-code-assist** (COMMENTED): ## Code Review

This pull request introduces a new specification format `tf-spec` along with its JSON schema, documentation, and example files. It also provides Rust and TypeScript adapters for parsing and serializing this format, complete with round-trip tests. My review focuses on improving the robustness, maintainability, and test coverage of these new adapters. I've suggested using more idiomatic and type-safe constructs in the Rust implementation, improving the structure of the TypeScript parser for future extensibility, and adding negative test cases for both adapters to ensure error paths are also validated.

- **gemini-code-assist** (COMMENTED): ## Code Review

This pull request introduces the `tf-spec` format, a language-agnostic specification for Trustfall, along with its JSON schema, documentation, and example files. It also implements round-trip adapters in both Rust and TypeScript to ensure parity, supported by new tests. The implementation is solid, but I've identified a critical inconsistency in the serialization logic between the Rust and TypeScript adapters that undermines the goal of deterministic output. Additionally, I've provided suggestions to improve the robustness of the tests by removing fragile relative paths and to enhance type safety in the TypeScript implementation. The documentation also has a minor omission that should be addressed for clarity.
