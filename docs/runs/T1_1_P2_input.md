- **gemini-code-assist** (COMMENTED): ## Summary of Changes

Hello @andreidita22, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request refines the definition and validation of `tf-spec` across the codebase. It introduces a more stringent schema for task execution specifications, ensuring that only a predefined set of operations with their mandatory parameters are accepted. This is supported by robust runtime validation and extensive testing in both TypeScript and Rust adapters, alongside a centralized script for schema validation.

### Highlights

* **Schema Tightening**: The `tf-spec` schema and its documentation have been significantly tightened to exclusively permit `copy`, `create_network`, and `create_vm` operations, each with their explicitly required parameters.
* **Runtime Validation and Testing**: Both TypeScript and Rust adapters have been hardened with explicit runtime validation logic and comprehensive negative tests to ensure adherence to the new `tf-spec` structure.
* **Validation Script Relocation**: The core validation logic has been moved to a dedicated script under `.codex/scripts`, with a simplified wrapper provided in `scripts/validate-tf-spec` for easier execution.

- **gemini-code-assist** (COMMENTED): ## Code Review

This pull request does a great job of tightening the `tf-spec` schema and adding validation at multiple levels. The new JSON schema is strict and well-defined, and the addition of validation scripts and adapter-level checks in both Rust and TypeScript significantly improves the robustness of the spec handling. My review focuses on making the validation even more robust and developer-friendly. I've suggested improvements to error reporting in the validation script and Rust adapter, and proposed tightening the TypeScript validation to match the strictness of the schema and the Rust implementation. I've also recommended additional test cases to cover these new validation rules.

- **gemini-code-assist** (COMMENTED): ## Code Review

This pull request introduces a new `tf-spec` schema and corresponding adapters for Rust and TypeScript. The changes are well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, good use of schema for validation, and accompanying tests.

My review focuses on improving correctness and robustness:
- I've pointed out missing validation in both Rust and TypeScript adapters to fully align with the schema constraints.
- I've suggested improvements to the validation script to make it more robust and developer-friendly by handling errors gracefully and reporting all issues at once.
- I've also recommended making the assertions in the Rust negative tests more specific to improve their reliability.

Overall, this is a solid contribution. Addressing these points will make the new functionality even more reliable.

Hello @andreidita22, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request significantly enhances the robustness and clarity of the `tf-spec` format by introducing a strict JSON schema that enforces primitive types for operation parameters. It includes a new validation script to ensure compliance, updated documentation for better understanding, and corresponding parsing and serialization adapters in both TypeScript and Rust. These changes collectively aim to improve the reliability and maintainability of systems interacting with `tf-spec` by catching schema violations early and providing clear guidelines.

### Highlights

* **Schema Hardening**: The `tf-spec` schema and documentation have been significantly hardened to enforce primitive parameter constraints, ensuring that `params` within steps only accept string, number, or boolean values.
* **Validation Script Relocation**: The `tf-spec` validator script has been moved to the `.codex` directory, centralizing internal tooling.
* **Runtime Validation and Testing**: New runtime validation logic and comprehensive negative tests have been added for both TypeScript and Rust adapters, ensuring robust handling of valid and invalid `tf-spec` inputs.
* **Ajv Integration**: The Ajv library is now used for JSON schema validation, leveraging its `allowUnionTypes` flag and integrated via a new wrapper script.

- **gemini-code-assist** (COMMENTED): ## Code Review

This pull request does a great job of tightening the validation for the `tf-spec` format. The introduction of a JSON schema, along with validation logic in both the TypeScript and Rust adapters, significantly improves the robustness of the spec processing. The new validation script and documentation are also valuable additions.

My review includes a few suggestions to further improve the code:
- In the Node.js validation script, I've pointed out a need for better error handling to prevent crashes on invalid files.
- For the Rust adapter, I've suggested a small refactoring to make the validation logic more extensible for future operations.
- In the TypeScript adapter, I've proposed a change to make the operation validation cleaner and more maintainable.

Overall, these are solid changes that strengthen the project's data validation.
