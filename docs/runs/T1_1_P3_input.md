- **gemini-code-assist** (COMMENTED): ## Summary of Changes

Hello @andreidita22, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request refines the `tf-spec` system by introducing a formal JSON schema for validation and implementing robust, path-aware validation logic in both TypeScript and Rust adapters. It also enhances the developer experience with a new validation script that aggregates errors and updates documentation to clearly define the spec and provide examples.

### Highlights

* **Validator UX Improvement**: The `tf-spec` validator now aggregates all schema errors into a single report and exits with a non-zero status on failure, improving the user experience for identifying issues.
* **Enhanced TS and Rust Adapters**: Both TypeScript and Rust adapters have been updated to strictly enforce schema parameters and provide descriptive, path-aware error codes for better debugging and compliance.
* **Updated Documentation**: The `tf-spec` documentation now includes links to example files and clearly outlines all allowed operations along with their required parameters.

- **gemini-code-assist** (COMMENTED): ## Code Review

This pull request introduces the `tf-spec` format, complete with a JSON schema, documentation, examples, and validation logic in a standalone script, a Rust adapter, and a TypeScript adapter. The changes are well-structured and successfully implement path-aware error messages and negative test cases. My review focuses on enhancing the robustness and maintainability of the new code. I've suggested improvements to error handling in the validation script, opportunities to reduce code duplication in the Rust and TypeScript adapters, and ways to make error messages more specific. I also recommended a more robust approach to file paths in the Rust tests. Overall, this is a solid contribution that significantly polishes the `tf-spec` implementation.

This pull request introduces the `tf-spec` format, complete with a JSON schema, documentation, examples, and a validation script. It also adds parsers in TypeScript and Rust that provide detailed, path-aware error messages. The changes are well-organized, and the focus on developer experience through clear validation is a great addition. My review includes suggestions to enhance the validator's robustness, correct and simplify logic in the Rust parser, and improve the maintainability of both the Rust and TypeScript parsers by refactoring. I've also added minor recommendations for improving documentation formatting.

Hello @andreidita22, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request focuses on refining the `tf-spec` implementation by enhancing its validation mechanisms, improving the robustness of its TypeScript and Rust language adapters, and updating its documentation. The changes aim to provide a clearer, more reliable, and better-documented specification for task execution, particularly by improving error reporting and ensuring strict adherence to the spec's structure and parameters.

### Highlights

* **Validator UX Improvement**: The `tf-spec` validator now aggregates all errors and presents them in a single, consolidated summary, enhancing the user experience for identifying specification issues.
* **Enhanced Language Adapters**: Both TypeScript and Rust `tf-spec` adapters have been strengthened with explicit parameter validation checks and comprehensive negative test coverage to ensure robust and reliable spec processing.
* **Updated Documentation**: The `tf-spec` documentation has been expanded to include a clear table of allowed operations and direct links to example specification files, improving clarity and discoverability.

- **gemini-code-assist** (COMMENTED): ## Code Review

This pull request does a great job of polishing the `tf-spec` validation and implementation. The new validator script with aggregated errors is a nice UX improvement, and the negative tests for the TS and Rust adapters add valuable robustness. My review includes a few suggestions to improve maintainability and performance. In the Rust adapter, I've pointed out opportunities to reduce code duplication and leverage `serde`'s declarative features more fully. For the TypeScript adapter, I've suggested minor refactors to improve efficiency. I also found a potential crash in the validation script if it encounters an unparseable JSON file and suggested a fix. Overall, these are solid changes.

## Summary (‚â§ 3 bullets)
- Aggregated tf-spec validator errors with a single exit code and wrapper; wrote summary file
- Hardened TS adapter validation with path-specific errors and mirrored Rust negatives
- Documented allowed ops with required params and linked examples directory

## Determinism & Hygiene
- Byte-identical outputs across repeats: ‚úÖ

## Self-review checklist (must be all ‚úÖ)
- [x] Production code changed (tests only ‚â† pass)
- [x] Inputs validated; 4xx on bad shapes
- [x] No new runtime deps (unless allowed)
- [x] CI gauntlet green

## Delta since previous pass (‚â§ 5 bullets)
- Aggregated validator errors and summary output
- Tightened TS validation with path-specific error codes
- Added precise Rust negative tests mirroring TS behavior
- Documented allowed operations and linked examples directory

## Review Focus
```yaml
task: T1_1
pass: 3
focus:
  - validator UX: aggregated errors & single exit status
  - scripts policy: .codex impl + /scripts wrapper only
  - TS validation/messages tightened to schema (no as any)
  - Rust negative tests: specific error codes/paths
  - determinism: double-run equality
tripwires:
  - esm_dot_js: true
  - no_deep_imports: true
  - scripts_wrappers_only: true
  - no_new_runtime_deps: true

### Selected Reviews (codex/gemini)

- **gemini-code-assist** (COMMENTED): ## Summary of Changes

Hello @andreidita22, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request significantly refines the `tf-spec` definition and its ecosystem by introducing formal JSON schema validation, robust language-specific adapters for parsing and serialization in TypeScript and Rust, and comprehensive documentation. The changes aim to improve the developer experience by providing clearer validation feedback, ensuring consistency across different language implementations, and offering concrete examples of the specification's usage.

### Highlights

* **Enhanced tf-spec Validation**: Introduced a new validation script (`validate-tf-spec.mjs`) that aggregates errors, provides a single exit code, and generates a summary file for `tf-spec` examples against a new JSON schema.
* **Robust Language Adapters**: Implemented and hardened `tf-spec` parsing and serialization in both TypeScript and Rust, ensuring path-specific error messages and mirroring negative test cases across both languages for consistent validation.
* **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed documentation for the `tf-spec` format, outlining its fields, providing examples, and explicitly listing allowed operations with their required parameters.
* **New JSON Schema**: A `tf-spec.schema.json` file was added to formally define the structure and validation rules for `tf-spec` documents, including specific constraints for operations and their parameters.
* **Example Specifications**: Several example `tf-spec` JSON files (`copy.json`, `multi.json`, `vm.json`) were added to demonstrate valid usage of the specification.

- **gemini-code-assist** (COMMENTED): ## Code Review

This pull request does a great job of formalizing the `tf-spec` with a JSON schema, documentation, and validator script. The Rust and TypeScript adapters are well-tested with both positive and negative cases. My review focuses on improving the robustness of the validator script and reducing code duplication in the Rust and TypeScript parsers for better long-term maintainability. I've identified a critical issue in the validator script that could cause it to crash, and several medium-severity opportunities to refactor the parsing logic for clarity and safety.
