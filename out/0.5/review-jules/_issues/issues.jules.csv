A,"LSP is not runnable without a launch configuration",S1,dx,A-LSP,S,"A new dev cannot run or debug the LSP. Add a .vscode/launch.json file."
A,"Key packages lack README files",S2,docs,A-LSP,M,"packages/tf-lsp-server has no README. others are stubs. A dev has no starting point."
A,"""DSL"" terminology is misleading",S3,docs,A-DSL,M,"The ""DSL"" is a JSON IR, not a human-writable language. This causes confusion. Clarify in docs."
A,"No examples of broken inputs for LSP",S3,dx,A-LSP,S,"Provide examples of malformed L0 JSON to show how diagnostics should appear."
B,"No standalone CLI to run a single bytecode file",S2,dx,B-Runtime,M,"Devs must run the entire test suite to see one program execute. Create a simple runner."
B,"Runtime timeout and retry policies are undocumented",S2,docs,B-Runtime,S,"The host's responsibility for timeouts is a critical, undocumented architectural detail."
B,"The Host interface contract is not documented",S3,docs,B-Runtime,M,"Document the methods in the Host interface to enable integration."
C,"Trace tool requires manual build step after install",S1,dx,C-Trace,S,"The tool fails with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND out of the box. Use a postinstall script to build."
C,"CLI binary links are broken",S2,dx,C-Trace,S,"pnpm install warns about failed bin links. Fix package.json to enable `pnpm tf-trace`."
C,"Importance of --fail-on-violation flag is not documented",S3,docs,C-Trace,S,"The flag is essential for CI but is not highlighted in the documentation."
D,"Optimizer tool is broken and fails on launch",S1,dx,D-Opt,S,"The tool is unusable due to a SyntaxError. This is a blocking issue."
D,"Optimizer package has no README",S2,docs,D-Opt,M,"Add a README explaining the passes and how to run the tool."
D,"No sample IR files for the optimizer",S2,dx,D-Opt,S,"A developer cannot test or learn the optimizer without sample data."
D,"Optimizer passes cannot be individually disabled",S4,dx,D-Opt,L,"Add a --disable-pass flag for more granular control during development."
E,"No integrated tool to run proofs",S1,dx,E-Proofs,M,"Running proofs requires manual scripting and an external SMT solver. Create a `pnpm test:proofs` script."
E,"Proofs package has no README",S2,docs,E-Proofs,M,"Add a guide that explains SMT, Z3 installation, and how to interpret results."
E,"SMT solver (Z3) is an unstated dependency",S2,docs,E-Proofs,S,"The dependency on Z3 must be clearly documented."
E,"Proof law `idempotent:write-by-key` has a misleading name",S3,docs,E-Proofs,S,"The law checks for non-idempotence. Rename it to avoid confusion."
F,"Changelog generator incorrectly categorizes commits",S2,release,F-DevEx,M,"Most commits land in ""Other"". Improve parsing of conventional commit types."
F,"Consumer of the documentation build artifact is unclear",S3,docs,F-DevEx,S,"Document the purpose of `out/0.5/docs/index.json` and what consumes it."
F,"Release dry-run does not verify generated artifacts",S4,release,F-DevEx,L,"Add a verification step to the release workflow to check the generated artifacts for correctness."
