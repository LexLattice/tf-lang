# Executive Brief: TF Lang 0.5 Documentation & DX Review

**Date:** September 29, 2025
**Author:** Jules, Engineering Program Manager

## 1. Overview

This review assesses the documentation and developer experience (DX) of TF Lang v0.5 across six key tracks. The goal is to identify critical gaps and propose targeted improvements to make local workflows "first-try successful" for new contributors.

**The Bottom Line:** The foundational components of TF Lang 0.5 are in place, but the project suffers from a systemic lack of "last-mile" DX and documentation. Key tools are broken, quickstart guides are missing, and core concepts are not explained. As a result, a new engineer cannot independently build, run, or test the system.

The following table summarizes the most critical gaps that should be addressed before the 0.5 release.

## 2. Top 7 Gaps & Suggested Actions

| Rank | Track(s) | Gap Description | Effort | Owner | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | A, D | **Broken Tools Block Development:** The Optimizer (`tf-opt`) is unusable due to a runtime error, and the LSP has no launch configuration, making it impossible to run. | **S** | A-LSP, D-Opt | **Core Dev Loop** |
| **2** | A, B, C, E, F | **Missing "How-to-Run" Guides:** Critical components (LSP, Runtime, Proofs, Release) lack basic `README.md` files with step-by-step instructions. | **M** | All Leads | **Onboarding** |
| **3** | C | **Build Step DX Friction:** The `tf-trace` tool requires a manual build step (`pnpm build`) after `pnpm install`, which is an immediate and confusing failure point for new users. | **S** | C-Trace | **DX** |
| **4** | A, E | **Misleading Naming & Terminology:** Core concepts are poorly named (e.g., the "DSL" is an IR, a proof for "idempotence" checks the opposite), causing significant confusion. | **M** | A-DSL, E-Proofs | **Clarity** |
| **5** | E | **No Integrated Proof Runner:** The SMT proofs require manual script generation and an unstated dependency on an external solver (Z3), making them inaccessible. | **M** | E-Proofs | **Verification** |
| **6** | F | **Ineffective Changelog Generation:** The release script buckets most commits under "Other," defeating the purpose of an automated, human-readable changelog. | **M** | F-DevEx | **Release** |
| **7** | D | **No Sample Data for Optimizer:** The optimizer tool has no sample IR files to run on, making it impossible to test, benchmark, or learn. | **S** | D-Opt | **Testing** |

## 3. Recommendations

To prepare for a successful 0.5 release, we recommend a short "DX hardening" sprint focused on the following priorities:

1.  **Fix Broken Tools (Gap #1):** The highest priority is to ensure all tools are runnable out of the box. This is a small amount of work that unblocks all other development and testing.
2.  **Author Quickstart Guides (Gap #2):** Each track lead should be responsible for creating a minimal `README.md` that allows a new contributor to achieve one "first result" success.
3.  **Automate and Integrate (Gaps #3, #5):** Implement `postinstall` scripts for tools that need building and create an integrated test runner for the proofs.

Addressing these foundational issues will dramatically improve the onboarding experience and position the TF Lang 0.5 release as a solid foundation for future development.
