B,Expander drops inline comments causing run-examples to fail,S1,dx,Expander,S,"Reproduce: bash tasks/run-examples.sh → invalid call syntax … # types; strip comments during macro preprocessing so L2→L0 works first try."
A,L0 schema outdated for structured transform inputs,S1,release,Platform,M,"tf validate fails on examples/v0.6/build/*.l0.json because schemas/l0-dag.schema.json still expects scalar in bindings; regenerate schema + fixtures."
C,Checker idempotency stays RED on flagship pipelines,S2,release,Checker+Macros,M,"packages/checker/check.mjs reports unstable-corr on rpc:req publishes even with hashed corr; either stabilize corr derivation or downgrade severity before release."
