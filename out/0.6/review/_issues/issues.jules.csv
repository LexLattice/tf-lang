A,"CLI aliases are broken and commands are verbose",S2,dx,Platform Lead,S,"pnpm install log shows warnings that bin links failed to create; commands require full node path."
A,"Root README.md is outdated and references v0.5",S1,docs,Platform Lead,M,"The main entrypoint for new contributors points to old examples and commands, causing confusion."
A,"Missing core contribution and v0.6 specification documentation",S2,docs,Platform Lead,M,"No CONTRIBUTING.md exists, and v0.6 docs explicitly state spec pages are missing."
A,"Schema directory contains mixed versions (v0.4 and current)",S3,dx,Platform Lead,S,"Presence of old schemas like trace.v0.4.schema.json can lead to developers referencing outdated structures."
B,"No direct CLI command for L2->L0 expansion",S2,dx,Engine Lead,S,"Core engine function is not discoverable; users must find wrapper scripts."
B,"Fragile YAML pre-processor for multi-line macros",S2,release,Engine Lead,M,"String-based regex hack for parsing macros is error-prone and should be replaced with standard YAML features."
B,"Transform runner is a monolithic switch statement",S3,dx,Engine Lead,M,"Adding new transform ops requires editing a large central file, hindering extensibility."
B,"Instance registry v2 logic is undocumented",S3,docs,Engine Lead,S,"The rule-based matching for instance resolution is not explained anywhere."
C,"Runtime duplicates Transform logic from the Transform package",S1,release,Runtime Lead,S,"packages/runtime/run.mjs re-implements transform logic instead of importing it, creating a major maintenance hazard."
C,"No direct CLI command to execute an L0 pipeline",S2,dx,Runtime Lead,M,"The L0 runtime is not exposed via the CLI, making it hard to test or debug pipelines directly."
C,"Checker output is JSON-only with no human-readable summary",S2,dx,Runtime Lead,M,"Diagnosing failures requires parsing a large TFREPORT.json file; a console summary would improve DX."
C,"Z3 prover integration and custom law authoring is undocumented",S3,docs,Prover Lead,M,"No documentation explains how to use the Z3 harness or write new Z3-backed laws."
D,"End-to-end example script is broken",S1,release,Examples Lead,S,"tasks/run-examples.sh fails immediately due to a parsing error in an L2 YAML, blocking all example-based workflows."
D,"Missing README in examples directory",S3,docs,Examples Lead,S,"The examples/v0.6/ directory lacks a README to explain the examples or how to run them."
D,"Undocumented 'dot' dependency for SVG diagram generation",S4,dx,Examples Lead,S,"SVG diagrams are not generated if 'dot' (graphviz) is missing, and the user is not notified."
E,"Law checking is disconnected and not dynamic",S1,release,Prover Lead,L,"The checker runs static samples instead of verifying the laws attached to the actual L0 nodes, creating a critical correctness gap."
E,"Missing L1 macros for authentication",S2,dx,Engine Lead,M,"The 'auth.*' macros are part of the v0.6 scope but are not implemented in the expander."
E,"Macro and law extension process is undocumented",S3,docs,Engine Lead,M,"There is no guide explaining how to add new macros or create new law checkers."
E,"Inconsistent parameter names in 'await' macros",S4,dx,Engine Lead,S,"process.await.* macros accept 'sources', 'targets', or 'inputs' for the same parameter, causing confusion."
F,"Typechecker suggests adapters but cannot apply them",S2,dx,Engine Lead,L,"No --autofix mode exists; developers must manually edit L0 files to insert adapters, which is error-prone."
F,"Port typing syntax and features are undocumented",S3,docs,Engine Lead,M,"The metadata.port_types syntax, including wildcards and defaults, is not documented."
F,"Capability lattice is incomplete",S2,release,Platform Lead,S,"The lattice at policy/capability.lattice.json is missing definitions for channels like 'metric:*' and 'policy:*'."
F,"Type descriptor parsing logic is complex and unclear",S4,dx,Engine Lead,M,"The functions for parsing type descriptors in the typechecker are convoluted and hard to maintain."
