# TF-Lang v0.6 · Cross-track release review

## Overall status
- **Quickstart fails**: the intended `tasks/run-examples.sh` smoke aborts on inline macro comments, so new contributors never see a green run without hand-editing YAML.
- **Schema + checker drift**: L0 builds use structured transform inputs and monitors bundles the current schemas reject, and the checker flags idempotency/capabilities gaps on flagship pipelines.
- **Docs lag**: README + overview still point to v0.5; v0.6 pages exist but lack quickstarts, spec, and macro/type references.

## Top 7 gaps to unblock tagging

| # | Gap | Cost | Owner (suggested) | Impact area | Notes |
|---|-----|------|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Expander cannot parse inline `#` comments, breaking `tasks/run-examples.sh` and all L2 → L0 regenerations. | **S** | Track B (Expander) | DX | Strip comments in macro preprocessing or adjust YAML authorship so quickstart passes. Evidence: `invalid call syntax … # types` when running examples. |
| 2 | `tf validate` fails on shipping L0 because `schemas/l0-dag` still expects scalar `in` fields. | **M** | Track A (Platform schemas) | Release | Update schema + tests to reflect structured inputs and monitors before we can claim 0.6 compatibility. |
| 3 | Checker defaults to RED on showcase pipelines due to `unstable-corr` idempotency checks despite deterministic macros. | **M** | Tracks C/E (Checker + macro owners) | Release | Need either deterministic corr seeds or downgraded law severity; current report blocks GA. |
| 4 | No v0.6 quickstart or per-track README—contributors land on v0.5 docs. | **S** | Track A (Docs) | Docs/DX | Publish install → run examples → checker workflow and link from README + docs/0.6. |
| 5 | CLI lacks `tf expand`/`tf check` entrypoints; teams must call node scripts manually. | **M** | Tracks A/B/C | DX | Add subcommands wrapping expander + checker with proper usage and exit codes. |
| 6 | Runtime smoke missing: no `tf run` to execute L0 on memory bus. | **M** | Track C (Runtime) | DX/Release | Without it we cannot demo end-to-end behavior; add minimal executor harness. |
| 7 | Law tooling emits NEUTRAL with no counterexamples; prover payloads not exposed. | **S** | Track H (Prover) | Release/docs | Surface counterexamples/assignments so branch exclusivity issues are actionable before tagging. |

## Immediate recommendations
1. Fix expander comment handling and re-run `tasks/run-examples.sh`; use that script as the anchor for quickstart documentation.
2. Regenerate schemas + CLI validators in lockstep with v0.6 kernel shape; add regression tests using the shipped L0 JSON.
3. Decide on idempotency posture: either make corr derivation deterministic (preferred) or downgrade the law to WARN for known-entropy nodes before release.
4. Publish a v0.6 overview (README link + docs) with the exact commands: install → expand → typecheck → plan-instances → checker → laws.
5. Wrap expander/checker in official `tf` subcommands with exit codes so CI and onboarding scripts stop shelling into raw `.mjs` files.
6. Prioritize a minimal runtime driver (`tf run`) to demonstrate the deterministic bus; even a stub that logs publish/subscribe events will unblock demos.
7. Extend `tf laws --check --json` to include counterexample payloads for failing goals, and document how to interpret WARN vs ERROR statuses.
